directions: [
  "Place the sliced napa cabbage in a large bowl and season generously with kosher salt. Toss and firmly massage the cabbage to bruise the leaves.",
  "Let the cabbage rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, ideally up to 1½ hours, to draw out moisture.",
  "Meanwhile, prepare the paste by blending ginger, Asian pear, garlic, and fish sauce in a food processor until smooth.",
  "Transfer the paste to a bowl and stir in the Korean red pepper flakes. Taste and adjust spice level if desired.",
  "Rinse the salted cabbage thoroughly under cold running water, then drain and shake off excess moisture.",
  "Return the cabbage to a large bowl and add green onions, carrots, daikon radish, and the prepared paste. Toss until everything is evenly coated.",
  "Pack the kimchi tightly into a sterilized ½-gallon glass jar, pressing down firmly to remove air pockets and ensure vegetables are submerged in liquid.",
  "Loosely secure the lid to allow gases to escape and leave the jar at room temperature for 4–7 days.",
  "Check daily, pressing the kimchi down as needed. Begin tasting around day 4 and continue fermenting until desired flavor is reached.",
  "Once fermented to your liking, seal the jar fully and refrigerate. The kimchi is ready to eat and will continue to develop flavor over time."

- **Fermentation Tip:** Keep vegetables fully submerged to prevent mold.
- **Spice Level:** Add more gochugaru for extra heat.
- **Gloves Recommended:** Mixing by hand can stain skin due to red pepper flakes.
- **Storage:** Refrigerated kimchi will keep for weeks to months and continue to mature.
