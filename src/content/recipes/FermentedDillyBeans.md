directions: [
  "Pack the trimmed green beans, garlic, dill, bay leaves, mustard seeds, peppercorns, and optional hot pepper into a quart-sized mason jar.",

  "In a separate container, mix the salt into the water to create the brine, stirring until fully dissolved.",

  "Pour the brine over the beans in the jar, ensuring all ingredients are fully submerged.",

  "Place a fermentation weight on top to keep the green beans under the brine.",

  "Cover the jar with a clean cloth secured with a rubber band and place it in a dark, room-temperature area of your kitchen.",

  "After 7 days, taste the beans to check if they have reached the desired level of fermentation. If they are still too crunchy, allow them to ferment for up to another week.",

  "Once the beans have reached the desired texture and flavor, cap the jar with a lid and store in the refrigerator."

Tips:
- If this is your first time fermenting, I would recommend watching a video such as this one to become aquainted with the process [The Process of Fermentation](https://youtu.be/dKW7mLnSxU4?si=H_J-lnWjUFTvCPsI)
- The only ingredient in salt should be "salt". Using salt with anti-caking agents or other things can risk the ferment.
- Packing the beans upright in the jar allows for a more efficient fit and an aesthetically pleasing look.
- If your kitchen is particularly cold, the fermentation process may take longer than a week.
- Store the finished fermented beans in the refrigerator for extended shelf life.
