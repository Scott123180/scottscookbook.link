**Tips:**
- If your food processor blade slips, it may be overloaded or under too much resistance. Consider blending in smaller batches or adding a splash more oil for lubrication.
- When serving with pasta, save a few tablespoons of pasta water and mix it in with the pesto to help it coat the noodles smoothly and stretch the sauce.
