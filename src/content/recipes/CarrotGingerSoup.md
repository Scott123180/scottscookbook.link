directions: [
  "Warm the pot over medium heat and sauté the diced onions for about 2 minutes, just until they begin to soften.",
  "Toss in the sliced carrots along with a generous pinch of salt, stirring for 3–5 minutes until the carrots are well-coated and starting to soften.",
  "Mix in the minced ginger and orange zest, then add the stock or water.",
  "Increase the heat to bring the soup to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook for approximately 20 minutes, or until the carrots are fork-tender.",
  "Take the pot off the heat. Blend the soup until smooth using an immersion blender (or transfer in portions to a countertop blender).",
  "Season to taste with additional salt if needed.",
  "Serve hot, or let it cool and refrigerate for a couple of hours to enjoy chilled.",
  "Top with a dollop of yogurt or a sprinkle of herbs like basil or scallions, if you like."

Tips
- Double the amount of ginger... if you dare!
- I've only made this without the orange because I didn't want to zest and it's come out really good.
