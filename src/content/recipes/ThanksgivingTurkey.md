directions: [
  "If frozen, thaw the turkey in the refrigerator for 24 hours per 5 pounds. Add an extra day to be safe.",
  "Remove turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting to reach room temperature.",
  "Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C) and position the oven rack so the turkey will sit centered.",
  "Prepare the herb butter: In a small bowl, combine softened butter, minced garlic, salt, pepper, 1 tbsp rosemary, 1 tbsp thyme, and ½ tbsp sage.",
  "Remove the turkey neck and giblets from the cavities and pat the turkey very dry with paper towels.",
  "Season the cavity with salt and pepper, then stuff with onion, lemon, apple, and remaining herbs.",
  "Gently loosen the skin over the breasts and spread a few tablespoons of herb butter underneath.",
  "Tuck the wings under and place the turkey on a roasting rack in a roasting pan.",
  "Microwave the remaining herb butter for 30 seconds until very soft. Brush it evenly over the entire turkey, including legs and wings.",
  "Roast at 325°F (163°C) for about 13–15 minutes per pound, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) in the breast and thigh.",
  "About halfway through cooking, tent the turkey loosely with foil once the skin turns golden brown to prevent over-browning.",
  "When done, let the turkey rest for 20–30 minutes before carving to retain juices.",
  "Save any drippings in the pan to make turkey gravy."

- **Turkey Size:** For smaller groups, consider roasting just the turkey breast.
- **Herb Substitutes:** If using dried herbs, use 1 teaspoon dried per 1 tablespoon fresh.
- **Foil Tip:** Begin roasting uncovered; tent loosely once skin is golden.
- **Disposable Pan Tip:** Use chopped carrots and celery as a rack if you don’t have a roasting rack.
- **Convection Oven:** Check temperature earlier—start checking after 2 hours, as it will cook faster.
- **Leftovers:** Store carved turkey with pan juices in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
