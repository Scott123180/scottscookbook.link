- **Temperature Adjustment:** If baking alongside other dishes, you can adjust the oven temperature slightly up or down. Just keep an eye on the color and texture, adjusting bake time as needed.  
- **Make-Ahead Tip:** Toast bread and cook vegetables ahead of time. Store separately, then combine with egg and broth just before baking.  
- **Variation Ideas:** Try adding cooked sausage, diced apples, or cranberries for extra flavor.
