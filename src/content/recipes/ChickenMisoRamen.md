directions: [
  "Debone the chicken thighs and reserve the bones for the broth. Trim the ends from the bok choy and scallions. Slice the ginger and set aside.",
  "In a pot, combine chicken bones, scallion whites, ginger slices, bok choy trimmings, water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook gently for 45 minutes.",
  "Season the chicken thighs with salt. Place skin-side down in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook until the skin is deeply golden and the fat has rendered. Flip and cook until done. Remove and rest.",
  "Finely mince additional ginger. Add it to the rendered chicken fat and cook on low heat until fragrant and lightly caramelized, about 5 minutes. Remove ginger solids, leaving oil in the pan.",
  "Add miso paste to the ginger-infused oil and cook gently for 1–2 minutes to caramelize.",
  "Slowly ladle the hot broth into the miso mixture, stirring constantly to emulsify. Strain if desired and keep warm.",
  "Bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Gently add eggs and cook 6 minutes for jammy or 12 minutes for fully cooked. Transfer to cold water until ready to peel.",
  "Slice scallion greens on a bias. Boil bok choy in the same water for 1½ minutes until just tender. Remove and set aside.",
  "Cook ramen noodles in the boiling water for 1–2 minutes until just tender.",
  "To assemble, ladle hot broth into bowls. Add noodles, sliced chicken, halved eggs, bok choy, scallions, and caramelized ginger. Serve immediately."
