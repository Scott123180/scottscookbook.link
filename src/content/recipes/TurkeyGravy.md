directions: [
  "If using giblets: Place the neck, heart, and gizzards in a medium saucepan (discard the liver). Cover with water, bring to a boil, and simmer for about 1 hour until meat is cooked through.",
  "Remove giblets from the water with a slotted spoon. Shred the neck meat and finely dice all giblets. Reserve them for later use. Discard or save a bit of the cooking liquid if you prefer thinner gravy.",
  "Once the turkey has finished roasting, carefully pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a large bowl.",
  "Let the drippings rest for a few minutes to allow the fat to separate. Skim off most of the fat from the top, reserving about 1 cup of drippings for the gravy.",
  "In a large saucepan, combine 1 cup of drippings with ½ cup flour over medium heat. Whisk continuously to form a smooth paste (roux). If it looks greasy, sprinkle in a bit more flour until it thickens.",
  "Continue whisking the roux as it browns slightly, about 2–3 minutes, for a golden color and deeper flavor.",
  "Gradually pour in 4 cups of broth along with 1 additional cup of drippings. Whisk constantly until smooth and combined.",
  "Simmer for 5–8 minutes, whisking, until thickened. Stir in diced giblets if using.",
  "Adjust consistency: add giblet broth or drippings if too thick, or simmer longer if too thin. For extra thickening, mix 1 tbsp cornstarch with 1 tbsp water and whisk into the gravy.",
  "Season with salt and pepper to taste, then serve warm over turkey, mashed potatoes, or stuffing."

- **Make-Ahead Tip:** Prepare the gravy up to 2 days in advance. Reheat gently with a few tablespoons of broth or water to loosen as needed.  
- **Storage:** Store leftover gravy covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.  
- **Flavor Note:** Skipping the liver prevents a strong metallic flavor.
