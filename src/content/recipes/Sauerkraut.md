ingredients: [
  {
    name: Green Cabbage,
    amount: 1,
    unit: "to taste",
    section: Kraut
  },
  {
    name: Kosher Salt,
    amount: 2,
    unit: "percent by weight of cabbage",
    section: Kraut
  }
]
directions: [
  "Cut the cabbage in half, then into quarters.",
  "Slice out the core from each quarter.",
  "Thinly slice the cabbage into ribbons. You can use a food processor to make this faster",
  "Weigh the shredded cabbage and calculate 2% of the total weight to determine how much kosher salt to use (e.g., 1000g cabbage × 0.02 = 20g salt).",
  "Add the salt to the cabbage and massage or bruise vigorously for 2–5 minutes until it releases a generous amount of liquid.",
  "Transfer the cabbage and liquid into a clean, tight container. Firmly press the cabbage down so the liquid covers the top.",
  "Place crumpled plastic wrap over the top and use a weight (like a clean jar or fermentation stone) to keep the cabbage submerged.",
  "Cover the jar with a fermentation lid. If you don’t have one, loosely screw on a lid and burp the jar daily to release pressure. Don’t overtighten or it may explode.",
  "If not using a fermentation lid, you can keep pressing the cabbage down and compact it as it expands so everything stays under the brine.",
  "Check the kraut after 2 weeks. Once fermented to your taste, transfer to the fridge to store.",
  "Enjoy as a topping, side dish, or gut-friendly snack."
