- Rinsing Rice: If you rinse the rice before cooking, make sure to drain it well. To maintain the proper water-to-rice ratio, reduce about 3 tablespoons of water from the original 1 cup measurement.
- Leftovers: Allow rice to cool completely before storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
